# Determine Wine Quality

This machine learning program detects the wine quality of white wine

## Project Set Up and Installation
The initial set up steps is to have a
* workspace
* compute instance VM to run the Jupyter notebook
All remaining steps/configuration are part of the code

## Dataset

### Overview
The Wine Quality dataset is a freely available table that contains chemical characteristics based on physicochemical tests and a sensory quality score.
There are two datasets, one for red wine and one for white wine. We shall use the dataset for the white wine. The dataset can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/

### Task
The task is to predict the sensory quality of the wine given its chemical characteristics. There are 11 features or characteristics and all 11 will be used in this project.

### Access
The data will be available as a csv file in the project workspace. It will be read using the Pandas library as a Pandas dataframe and used from then on.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remember to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with its parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remember to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with its parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
