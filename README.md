# Determine Presence of Breast Cancer

This machine learning program detects the presence (or absence) of breast cancer from pertinent data regarding physical characteristics. 

## Project Set Up and Installation
The initial set up steps is to have a
* workspace
* compute instance VM to run the Jupyter notebook
All remaining steps/configuration are part of the code

## Dataset

### Overview
The dataset is at [Breast Cancer Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset). An understanding of the data can be had at https://www.kaggle.com/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset/discussion/66975#509394

### Task
The task is to predict the presence of breast cabcer given certain physical characteristics. There are 5 features or characteristics and all 5 will be used in this project.

### Access
The data is downloaded as a csv file from https://www.kaggle.com/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset . It is then made avalabe at a publicly available github such as https://github.com/dntrply/nd00333-capstone/raw/master/dataset/Breast_cancer_data.csv
The data is read into teh AzureML project and used from there on.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remember to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with its parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remember to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with its parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
